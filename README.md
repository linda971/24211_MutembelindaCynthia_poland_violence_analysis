Big Data Analysis of Rape and Domestic Violence in Poland (2013-2023)
Project Overview
This comprehensive Big Data analysis project examines patterns and trends in rape and domestic violence cases across Poland from 2013 to 2023. Using advanced data science techniques, this study provides evidence-based insights for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and social services to better understand and address violence against individuals.
The project demonstrates sophisticated Big Data methodologies including ETL pipelines, multi-dimensional statistical analysis, temporal trend identification, and scalable visualization techniques applied to sensitive social crime data.
Research Objectives

Pattern Recognition: Identify demographic and temporal patterns in violence cases across 11 years
Victim Analysis: Examine how age, gender, and time factors influence victimization rates
Trend Identification: Analyze statistical trends and changes from 2013-2023
Classification Comparison: Compare international (ICCS) vs national (Polish Criminal Code) reporting standards
Policy Support: Generate actionable insights for evidence-based policy development


Key Findings & Impact
Scale of Analysis

252,169 total victims analyzed across comprehensive 11-year dataset
693 detailed records covering all demographic and temporal combinations
3 offense classifications with dual international/national standards
7 age groups and 3 gender categories for granular analysis

Critical Discoveries
Crime Distribution (2023)

Domestic Violence Dominance: 18,701 victims (92.0% of all cases)
Rape Cases: 1,636 victims (8.0% combined across classification systems)
Total Impact: 20,337 victims affected in 2023 alone

Gender Disparities

Female Victims: 478 cases (94.5% of rape victims using ICCS classification)
Male Victims: 27 cases (5.3% of rape victims)
Underreporting Concern: Male victim numbers may indicate systematic underreporting

Age Vulnerability Patterns

Adults (30-49 years): Most vulnerable group with 190 victims (37.5% of rape cases)
Children (â‰¤16 years): 101 victims representing 20.0% of rape cases
Young Adults (17-29): 172 combined victims across age ranges
Elderly (50+ years): 41 victims (8.1% of cases)

Temporal Trends

Overall Decline: 18% reduction from 2014 peak (25,387) to 2023 (20,337)
Consistent Patterns: Stable reporting across classification systems
Recent Trend: Sustained 3-year decline suggesting improved prevention

Classification System Analysis

Reporting Gap: Polish Criminal Code reports 2.2x more cases than ICCS (1,130 vs 506)
624 Victim Difference: Significant measurement gap requiring policy attention
International Standards: ICCS provides more conservative, globally comparable metrics
